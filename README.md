Project Introduction 

This project is a modern and aesthetically designed Hero Section webpage created using HTML and CSS. The main objective of this design is to build a visually appealing landing section similar to professional website homepages. It focuses on clean layout, balanced spacing, and modern UI styling.

The webpage contains a navigation bar with menu items and a call-to-action button, followed by a hero section that includes a bold heading, descriptive paragraph, action buttons, and an image. The layout is structured using Flexbox to ensure proper alignment and spacing between text and image content.

CSS plays a major role in enhancing the visual appearance through gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism effects (blurred transparent container), soft shadows, rounded corners, and custom Google Fonts (Poppins). The buttons include hover-friendly styling to improve interactivity and user experience.

Overall, this project demonstrates front-end design fundamentals, layout structuring, and modern UI styling techniques used in professional landing pages.
